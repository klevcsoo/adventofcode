# Advent of Code _2022_

This is the **Advent of Code** 2022 calendar tasks done by me. There's a new task every day until Christmas and each of the tasks are made up of 2 sub-tasks (as I understand it).

You can check the calendar out [here](https://adventofcode.com).

You are also able to use whatever programming or scripting language you prefer, I went with Java because that is the single best language the planet has been blessed with and OOP is the most perfect thing ever obviously.

_I use Typescript for literally everything, so it's for the sake of variety._
