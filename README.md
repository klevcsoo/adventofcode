# Advent of Code

These are my solutions for the **Advent of Code** calendars. Every year, there's a new one, in which there are new tasks every day until Christmas and each of the tasks are made up of 2 sub-tasks.

You can check the calendar out [here](https://adventofcode.com).

You are also able to use whatever programming or scripting language you prefer, I went with Java because that is the single best language the planet has been blessed with and OOP is the most perfect thing ever obviously.

_I use Typescript for literally everything, so it's for the sake of variety._

Throughout the calendars I prioritise clean code, and understandability over performance or memory efficiency. For example, you might see me looping over an array more times than needed, in order to segment the code.
The reasons why this repo exists, are education, practice and improvement. So feel free to copy, download, use or do whatever you'd like with the code in the repository.
